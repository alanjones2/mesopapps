# [Hands on Data Visualization with Google Mesop](https://datavizandai.github.io/2024/10/26/atavizmesop.html) 

### Google Mesop is an easy-to-use Python UI framework. We see how to use it to create Data Visualization app with Plotly.

Files and directories:

- ``CO2`` - this directory contains all of the file for the data viz app
    - ``main.py`` is the file Mesop file that should be run and contains all of the pages
    - ``styles.py`` contains useful style that are used elsewhere
    - ``utils.py`` - useful functions like to construct the HTML for a Plotly chart
- ``samples`` - this directory contains sample file for demonstrating aspects of Mesop (e.g. components and layouts)
